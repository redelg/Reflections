When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When you want to share your files or collaborate with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because those changes added in github might have been done by other person so maybe we just want to keep 
    working with our files.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    A fork is a copy of a github repository to your repositories, making a reference to the user that created it.
    A clone is a copy of a repository made from a github or a local directory to your local directory.
    A branch is a named version of your work, you would use it when you want to do some experimental work.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    GitHub can compare the last version of the remote and compare and tell you if there is any conflicts.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    I would collaborate sending the files i have edited and made changes to the person i'm collaborating with, it would be easier not using the git console and would be harder to find and compare all the changes that were made.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    You want to make changes in a separate branch for collaborating sending a change you wand a to make to the main code and suggesting a pull request on github, also you can experiment o a new branch making
    a different version of your main work.
